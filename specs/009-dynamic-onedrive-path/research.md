# Research: Dynamic OneDrive Path Configuration

**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical uncertainties and establish implementation approaches

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Configuration Load/Save Performance Requirements

**Decision**: Sub-10ms configuration operations for startup performance  
**Rationale**: Configuration file operations are infrequent (startup + reconfiguration) and small JSON files load/save in microseconds. No performance optimization needed beyond basic file I/O.  
**Alternatives Considered**: In-memory caching, lazy loading - rejected as unnecessary for file sizes <1KB and infrequent access patterns.

### 2. Cross-Platform Path Handling Best Practices

**Decision**: Use pathlib.Path for all path operations with expanduser() for tilde expansion  
**Rationale**: pathlib provides cross-platform path handling, automatic separator conversion, and built-in expanduser() method. Integrates seamlessly with existing codebase that already uses pathlib.  
**Alternatives Considered**: os.path module (legacy), manual string manipulation (error-prone) - rejected in favor of modern pathlib approach.

### 3. Configuration File Format and Structure

**Decision**: JSON format with versioned schema for future extensibility  
**Rationale**: JSON is human-readable, built into Python standard library, and provides structured data with schema validation capability. Enables future configuration extensions without breaking changes.  
**Alternatives Considered**: YAML (external dependency), INI files (limited structure), pickle (security risk) - rejected for various technical reasons.

### 4. Error Handling Patterns for Path Validation

**Decision**: Explicit exception classes with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions  
**Rationale**: Path validation failures should provide clear guidance to users for resolution. Custom exception hierarchy enables specific error handling and appropriate user messaging.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Generic exceptions (poor UX), boolean return values (loses error context) - rejected for user experience reasons.

### 5. Integration Points with Existing Codebase

**Decision**: Modify constants.py to use dynamic path resolution with fallback to existing hardcoded values  
**Rationale**: Maintains backwards compatibility for users who haven't configured dynamic paths while enabling new functionality. Minimal impact on existing code.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Complete replacement of constants (breaking change), separate configuration system (complexity) - rejected to minimize migration overhead.

### 6. Testing Strategy for Filesystem Operations

**Decision**: Mock filesystem testing using pytest fixtures and temporary directories  
**Rationale**: Enables testing of path validation and configuration persistence without requiring actual OneDrive installations. Provides reliable test environment.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Real filesystem testing (unreliable), no testing (risky) - rejected for reliability and maintainability reasons.

## Implementation Approach

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "onedrive_base_path": "/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SharedLibraries-Deloitte(O365D)/AU CBO Practice - MO - Cloud Network & Security/_PRESALES/_PROPOSALS/_PricingToolAccel",
  "last_validated": "2025-10-28T10:30:00Z",
  "validation_status": "valid"
}
```

### Error Recovery Strategy
1. Invalid path provided → Re-prompt with validation error details
2. Configuration file corrupted → Recreate from user input
3. OneDrive temporarily offline → Graceful degradation with retry suggestions
4. Permission errors → Clear instructions for resolution

### Performance Considerations
- Configuration loaded once at startup, cached in memory
- Path validation occurs only when needed (lazy validation approach)
- JSON parsing/serialization negligible for small configuration files
- No impact on existing tool performance characteristics

# Implementation Plan: Dynamic OneDrive Path Configuration

**Branch**: `009-dynamic-onedrive-path` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-dynamic-onedrive-path/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement dynamic OneDrive path configuration to resolve deployment compatibility issues across different user machines with varying OneDrive folder mappings. The system will detect missing configuration on first run, guide users through interactive command-line setup to locate their PricingToolAccel folder, validate the folder structure, and persistently store configuration in user home directory. This eliminates hardcoded OneDrive paths and enables deployment across diverse OneDrive organizational structures.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (existing codebase requirement)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library (pathlib, os, json), existing codebase modules  
**Storage**: Local configuration file in user home directory (JSON format)  
**Testing**: Existing pytest framework with mock filesystem testing  
**Target Platform**: macOS and Windows (existing deployment targets)
**Project Type**: Single project extension (enhancing existing CLI tool)  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-10ms configuration operations, no impact on existing tool performance  
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, must work offline, backwards compatible with existing installations  
**Scale/Scope**: 10-50 users (internal team deployment), single configuration per user machine

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance

✅ **Automation Over Manual Work**: Eliminates manual path configuration for each deployment  
✅ **Atomic Function Design**: Configuration detection, validation, and storage as separate functions  
✅ **Python Best Practices**: Will follow PEP 8, type hints, comprehensive docstrings  
✅ **Modular Architecture**: New path configuration module with clear interface to existing code  
✅ **Data Source Flexibility**: Supports different OneDrive organizational structures

### Technical Standards Compliance

✅ **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, explicit error handling planned  
✅ **File Organization**: New module in existing src/ structure, clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Performance**: Lightweight configuration operations, no performance impact on main workflow  

### No Constitutional Violations Identified

### Post-Design Constitution Re-Check ✅

After completing research and design phases:

✅ **Automation Maintained**: Dynamic path configuration eliminates manual deployment steps  
✅ **Atomic Functions**: ConfigurationManager, SetupWizard, PathConfiguration as separate concerns  
✅ **Python Standards**: Type hints, docstrings, error handling documented in contracts  
✅ **Modular Design**: Clean interfaces between new path module and existing codebase  
✅ **Data Flexibility**: Supports any OneDrive organizational structure

**Constitutional Compliance**: All design decisions align with established principles

**Structure Decision**: Single project extension following existing src/ structure. New path configuration module added with minimal modifications to existing modules for integration. Maintains current directory organization while adding essential path management capability.

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

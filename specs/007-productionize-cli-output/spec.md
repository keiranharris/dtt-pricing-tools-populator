# Feature Specification: Productionize CLI Output with Verbose Logging Toggle

**Feature Branch**: `007-productionize-cli-output`  
**Created**: 25 October 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "productionize CLI output with verbose logging toggle"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Clean Production CLI Output (Priority: P1)

End users need a clean, minimal CLI interface that focuses only on essential user input prompts and major operation status updates, without technical logging details cluttering the output.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user-facing experience and directly impacts usability and professional appearance of the tool in production environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the CLI tool with verbose logging disabled and verifying only essential user input prompts and high-level operation status messages appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** verbose logging is disabled, **When** user runs the CLI tool, **Then** only user input prompts, operation confirmations, and success/error messages are displayed
2. **Given** verbose logging is disabled, **When** data population occurs, **Then** user sees only major operation status (e.g., "Populating data...", "Complete") without detailed field-by-field logging
3. **Given** verbose logging is disabled, **When** errors occur, **Then** user sees clear error messages without technical stack traces or debug information

---

### User Story 2 - Developer Debug Mode Toggle (Priority: P2)

Developers and support staff need the ability to enable verbose logging to see detailed operation information, field matching details, and technical diagnostics for troubleshooting and development purposes.

**Why this priority**: Essential for debugging and development but secondary to user experience. Can be implemented independently after clean output is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling verbose logging on and verifying all current INFO level messages and technical details are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** user runs the CLI tool, **Then** all current detailed logging information is displayed including field matching, data population steps, and technical diagnostics
2. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** data population occurs, **Then** user sees detailed field-by-field progress, matching scores, and internal operation details
3. **Given** verbose logging toggle is changed, **When** tool is run, **Then** output behavior immediately reflects the new setting without requiring restart

---

### User Story 3 - Operation Status Visibility (Priority: P3)

Users need to see clear progress indicators for major operations so they understand the tool is working and can track completion of long-running tasks.

**Why this priority**: Improves user confidence and reduces support requests about whether the tool is working. Lower priority as basic functionality works without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running operations and verifying appropriate status messages appear at key milestones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any logging mode, **When** major operations begin, **Then** user sees clear status messages indicating operation start
2. **Given** any logging mode, **When** operations complete successfully, **Then** user sees confirmation messages with key results
3. **Given** any logging mode, **When** operations fail, **Then** user sees actionable error messages with next steps

### Edge Cases

- What happens when verbose logging toggle is changed while operation is in progress?
- How does system handle logging configuration errors or invalid toggle values?
- What happens when logging system fails but main operations succeed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a global configuration toggle that controls verbose logging output
- **FR-002**: System MUST display only essential user input prompts and operation status when verbose logging is disabled
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all current technical logging details when verbose logging is enabled
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain clear operation status messages for major operations regardless of verbose logging setting
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all current functionality while changing only output verbosity
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide consistent logging behavior across all modules and operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow toggle configuration via `VERBOSE_LOGGING_ENABLED` constant in main file following existing configuration pattern
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to identify when operations start, progress, and complete regardless of logging mode

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Verbose Logging Toggle**: Global configuration flag that controls output verbosity (enabled/disabled state)
- **User Input Prompt**: Essential CLI prompts that collect user data (always displayed)
- **Operation Status Message**: High-level messages indicating major operation progress (always displayed)
- **Technical Log Entry**: Detailed diagnostic information including field matching, internal operations (only displayed when verbose enabled)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: How will users change the verbose logging toggle configuration? â†’ A: Configuration constant in main file (edit `VERBOSE_LOGGING_ENABLED = True/False`)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Production CLI output contains 80% fewer log lines compared to current verbose output while maintaining all essential user prompts
- **SC-002**: Users can complete all current workflows with verbose logging disabled without loss of critical information
- **SC-003**: Developers can enable verbose logging and see 100% of current detailed diagnostic information
- **SC-004**: Toggle configuration change takes effect within 1 second of modification
- **SC-005**: All major operations (file copying, data population, resource setup) display clear start/completion status messages regardless of verbose setting

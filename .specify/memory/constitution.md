# DTT Pricing Tools Populator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Automation Over Manual Work (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST eliminate manual administrative tasks. The primary goal is to transform weekly repetitive data entry overhead into zero-touch automation. All Excel spreadsheet population MUST be automated from structured data sources. Manual intervention should only be required for initial configuration or exceptional error handling.

### II. Atomic Function Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE) 
Every function MUST perform exactly one task with well-defined arguments and return values. Functions MUST be easily interfaced and composed without side effects. Single responsibility principle is strictly enforced. Functions MUST have comprehensive type hints, docstrings, and explicit error handling. No function should perform multiple unrelated operations.

### III. Python Best Practices (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow PEP 8 standards for naming conventions and code style. Variable and function names MUST use snake_case, class names MUST use PascalCase. All code MUST include type hints and comprehensive docstrings. Code style and conventions are non-negotiable and MUST be consistent across the entire codebase.

### IV. Modular Architecture
Code MUST be organized into discrete, reusable components that do not interfere with each other. Each module MUST have a clear purpose and well-defined interfaces. Components MUST be independently testable and documented. Configuration MUST be externalized and easily modifiable.

### V. Data Source Flexibility
The architecture MUST support multiple data sources: static Excel files, CLI structured input, and future extensible sources. Data reading and data processing MUST be clearly separated. Each data source type MUST have dedicated modules with consistent interfaces.

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All functions MUST include comprehensive type hints for parameters and return values
- All functions MUST include docstrings with clear parameter descriptions and usage examples
- Error handling MUST be explicit with informative error messages for user-facing issues
- Input validation MUST be implemented for all external data sources
- Code MUST be testable in isolation without external dependencies

### File and Module Organization
- Separate modules MUST exist for different concerns (Excel operations, CLI interface, data processing)
- Clear separation MUST be maintained between data sources and data processing logic
- Configuration files MUST be externalized from code logic
- Directory structure MUST follow established Python project conventions

### Performance and Reliability
- Excel operations MUST be efficient and handle large datasets gracefully
- File locking and concurrent access MUST be handled appropriately
- System MUST provide clear progress feedback for long-running operations
- Recovery mechanisms MUST exist for partial failures

## Development Workflow

### Feature Implementation Process
1. All features MUST start with specification-driven development using speckit workflow
2. Implementation MUST follow the established phase structure: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation
3. Each feature MUST be developed in isolated branches following naming convention: `###-feature-name`
4. Code reviews MUST verify compliance with all constitution principles

### Testing and Validation Standards
- All code MUST be testable with mock data and isolated test environments
- Integration tests MUST cover Excel file operations and CLI interactions
- Error scenarios MUST be tested including missing files, invalid data, and permission errors
- User acceptance testing MUST validate elimination of manual processes

### Documentation Requirements
- All modules MUST include comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- API interfaces MUST be clearly documented with parameter specifications
- Configuration options MUST be documented with default values and examples
- User-facing documentation MUST include troubleshooting guides

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. All implementation decisions MUST align with these principles. When conflicts arise, constitution principles take precedence over convenience or legacy approaches.

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require explicit documentation of changes, clear rationale, and validation that existing features remain compliant. Version bumps follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications.

### Compliance Verification
All code reviews and feature implementations MUST verify alignment with constitutional principles. Complexity introduced must be justified against automation benefits. Non-compliance with core principles results in implementation rejection.
